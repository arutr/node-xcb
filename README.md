# node-xcb
Native Node.js bindings for XCB. Written using `node-addon-api` and TypeScript.

## Why?
*Why not?* JavaScript (and TypeScript) is pretty much everywhere. Let's bring it over to X11 too!

Abstracting complexities of C/C++ through a native Node.js module can introduce JavaScript developers
to the world of X11 in a 'cleaner' way.
